## Summary

This project implements the code and data necessary to generate the figures and results of the paper "Enhancing Dimension-Reduced Scatter Plots with Class and Feature Centroids."
This project contains multiple python scripts for generating the various results of the paper.

## Usage

Brief installation instructions can be found in [Setup](#setup), and use of the scripts can be found in [Execution](#execution).

### Setup

Create and activate a virtual Python environment with your favorite tool (e.g., `conda`, `mamba`, or `venv`).

For example, with `conda`:

```shell
conda create -n centroids python=3.11
conda activate centroidsd
```

Next, install dependencies while inside this virtual environment via the `requirements.txt` file at the top of this repo:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Execution
